# Zero-Knowledge Authentication System

A secure authentication system built using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK) with the zkAuth Kit and WebAssembly (WASM). This project simulates a registration and login flow using hashed passwords and proof-based authentication.

## Features
- **Registration and Login:** Users can register and log in with secure ZK-based authentication.
- **Hashed Passwords:** Passwords are hashed using the zkAuth Kit for secure storage.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** A ZK proof is generated on login and verified against stored hashes.
- **Simulated Backend:** User data is stored in local storage to simulate a backend environment.
